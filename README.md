# Project 2  
### Project Description  
1. For this second project, your task will be to "tell a story" through data visualizations. 

2. Unlike the first project, where you focused on using the "Analytics Paradigm" to explore relationships in "report form", this project should be more focused on providing users an interactive means to explore data themselves. 

3. Just as with the first project, you will be asked to conduct a 15 minute presentation and 5 minute questions that lays out your theme, coding approach, and final dashboard.

4. You may choose a project of any theme, but we encourage you to think broadly. The universe is wide and expansive. Don't limit yourself to what you know. 

5. You will have roughly two weeks to complete this project. You will present your final work on Saturday (Aug 25, 2018). You will have ample time in class to work with your group (but expect to put in some long nights in the days ahead).
